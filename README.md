- 👋 Hi, I’m Wawan
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Programming. My main skills are JavaScript (native, nodeJS, Puppeteer, etc), PHP (native, CodeIgniter), MariaDb, MySQL and Bootstrap CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Beautiful Soup, NLP) to support my Web Programming skill, ie, to enrich website content that I handle.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to my skills.
- 📫 Please contact me for prospective projects.
